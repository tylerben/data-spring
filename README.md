# Data Spring

Data Spring is designed streamline the process of generating fake datasets. Data Spring is available both as a library for use in other applications and as a standalone CLI. Prior to Data Spring, I spent far too much time generating datasets in Google Sheets using a combination of vlookups, array formulas, and rand functions. The process was tedious and made generating a new dataset tedios. Not to mention generating a 40,000 row dataset in Google Sheets was crazy sluggish.
